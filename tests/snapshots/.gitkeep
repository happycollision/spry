# GitHub API Snapshots

This directory contains recorded GitHub API responses for testing.

## Recording Snapshots

Run tests with `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` to record:

```bash
GITHUB_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 bun test tests/github/
```

## Replay Mode (Default)

Without the env var, tests replay from recorded snapshots:

```bash
bun test tests/github/
```

Tests with missing snapshots skip gracefully instead of failing.
